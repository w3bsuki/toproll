# Work Log

- 2025-09-28T20:33:35Z – Established OKLCH design tokens, Tailwind theme, shadcn-style component suite (button, card, tabs, badge, alert, sheet, dropdown, toast). Updated shell layout and key routes (home, cases, inventory, profile) to new marketplace aesthetic. Documented palette and usage guidelines.
- 2025-09-28T20:43:56Z – Ran `pnpm lint` (fails on existing unresolved routes/any typings); formatted touched files with Prettier.
- 2025-09-28T21:18Z – **GitHub PR #1 Successfully Merged**: User tested PR branch running on localhost:3002, determined it looked "10 times better" than polished version. Reset main branch to PR state (commit 9388a2a) to adopt superior marketplace UI implementation. **Status**: PR #1 marketplace theme now active on main branch.
- 2025-09-29T00:07:12Z – Completed desktop/mobile layout polish across home, cases, inventory, profile, and shell components. Added focus-visible treatments, converted CTA buttons to real links, standardized card heights, and made the chat drawer collapsible with accessible submit controls. `pnpm lint` still fails on legacy demo/test routes; `pnpm check` reports pre-existing typing issues (ErrorBoundary/ProfileCard), `pnpm test:unit -- --run` exits with Vitest browser runner error (no tests, watcher stays open), and `pnpm build` blocks on missing `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. Screenshots attempted via `browser_container` but Playwright runtime unavailable—needs follow-up when browser tooling works. Outstanding TODOs: clean legacy demo route lint errors, resolve Supabase env mock for builds, capture refreshed UI screenshots once tooling allows.
- 2025-09-29T04:15:00Z – Merged branch 'codex/polish-ui/ux-for-desktop-and-mobile' into main. Pre-merge checks: `pnpm lint` failed with 76 ESLint errors (mainly unused variables, any types, missing keys); `pnpm check` failed with 37 TypeScript/svelte-check errors (paraglide redeclarations, missing exports, type issues); `pnpm build` succeeded with warnings. Pushed to origin/main successfully.
