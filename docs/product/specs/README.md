# Module Specs Hub

This directory contains module-level PRDs that extend the launch PRD.
Each spec follows the spec-first workflow outlined in `docs/product/README.md`:

1. Document MVP scope, success criteria, data contracts, and UX flows.
2. Reference the relevant requirements/tasks that implementation PRs must satisfy.
3. Link back to the main PRD sections to keep the narrative consistent.

When adding a new module spec, update `docs/product/status.md` and `tasks.md`
so delivery tracking stays in sync.
