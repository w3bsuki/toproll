# Phase P0 — Project Charter & Baseline (Spec)

**Status:** Draft • **Phase Owner:** Orchestrator • **Labels:** `phase/p0`, `type/spec`

## 1. Objectives

- Normalize the canonical product docs (PRD, requirements, roadmap) and align them within `docs/product/`.
- Establish the operating playbook (spec rhythm, labels, branch naming, MCP usage).
- Ensure baseline engineering docs exist (`docs/engineering/{architecture,testing,observability,security,infra}.md`).
- Add repository hygiene items (.github templates, CI skeleton).

## 2. Deliverables

| Item                                                   | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs/product/README.md`                               | Explains the spec-driven workflow and conventions. **(Done)**                                      |
| `docs/product/PRD.md` & `docs/product/requirements.md` | Mirror canonical docs with links; describe how deltas are tracked. **(Done)**                      |
| `docs/product/status.md`                               | Shows per-phase doc + implementation status. **(Done)**                                            |
| `docs/product/phases/P0.md`                            | This spec document with checklists. **(In progress)**                                              |
| `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`                     | Outlines spec vs implementation checklist, testing, linked tasks. **(Done)**                       |
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`                              | Templates for spec request, implementation task, bug report (optional but recommended). **(Done)** |
| `.github/CODEOWNERS`                                   | Assigns review ownership (at minimum, orchestrator). **(Done)**                                    |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml`                             | Runs `pnpm lint`, `pnpm check`, `pnpm test -- --run`. **(Done)**                                   |
| `docs/engineering/adr/ADR-YYYYMMDD-spec-workflow.md`   | Captures the decision to formalize this spec-first process. **(Done)**                             |
| `docs/tasks.md`                                        | Updated with P0 subtasks referencing this spec anchors.                                            |

## 3. Scope

### In Scope

- Documentation updates and lightweight configuration scaffolding (templates, CI stub).
- No production code changes beyond what is required to support CI (e.g., ensure scripts exist).

### Out of Scope

- Implementing actual features (Auth, Inventory, etc.).
- Full CI hardening (matrix, preview deploy) – reserved for P2.

## 4. Process & Governance

1. Raise `feature/p0-spec-hub` branch.
2. Update/author the deliverables listed above.
3. Run smoke commands locally: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm check`, `pnpm test -- --run` to ensure CI will pass once workflow is added.
4. Submit Spec PR tagged with `phase/p0` and `type/spec`.
5. Upon approval, create tracking issues/tasks for implementation phases that depend on this foundation.

## 5. Tasks & Checklist

[x] Create product docs hub (`docs/product/README.md`).
[x] Mirror PRD and requirements into product hub.
[x] Add phase status dashboard.
[x] Add `.github` scaffolding (PR template, issue templates, CODEOWNERS, labels doc if needed).
[x] Add CI skeleton workflow (passes locally).
[x] Create ADR for spec-driven governance.
[ ] Update `docs/tasks.md` P0 section with sub-tasks referencing this spec.
[ ] Document MCP orchestration usage in `tasks.md` (already partially present, confirm alignment).

| Dependency                  | Notes                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CLI tools (`pnpm`, Node 20) | Ensure `use-node20.ps1` is followed; CI uses same version.       |
| Team alignment              | CODEOWNERS requires identifying reviewers; confirm availability. |

**Risks**

- Missing CI prerequisites (e.g., `pnpm test` not stable) – mitigate by running locally before enabling workflow.
- Scope creep into P1 items – enforce spec boundaries in PR review.

## 7. Acceptance / Hand-off

The phase is "Spec Approved" when:

- All deliverables above exist with checkboxes updated.
- ADR merged documenting the workflow decision.
- `docs/tasks.md` enumerates actionable P0 tasks referencing this spec.

Hand off to Claude-Code (implementation agent) once the Spec PR is merged; the implementation PR should:

- Add the `.github` files and CI workflow.
- Validate CI passes in GitHub.
- Update status dashboard (Doc → Approved, Implementation → In Progress/Done).
